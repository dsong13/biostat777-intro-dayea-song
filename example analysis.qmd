## Survival of Passengers on the Titanic

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
[**Research Question**]{style="color: brown; font-size: 1.2em;"}<br> The Titanic, a British ocean liner, was renowned as the largest ship afloat and famously dubbed "unsinkable." However, during its maiden voyage from England to New York in 1912, the ship tragically sank after striking an iceberg. This disaster led to the loss of many lives, sparking debates about survival factors, especially in the context of social class and the “women and children first” policy[@riniolo2003titanic].

This analysis aims to answer the question: **Did the "women and children first" policy affect Titanic survival rates differently across passenger classes?**

[**Intended Audience**]{style="color: brown; font-size: 1.2em;"}<br> This analysis is intended for data scientists and a general audience interested in understanding social dynamics through historical events. By examining survival rates across different classes and demographic groups (age and sex), we gain insight into how the "women and children first" policy may have been applied unevenly across social strata, reflecting broader societal factors at play.

[**Dataset**]{style="color: brown; font-size: 1.2em;"}<br> Data was obtained from Rdatasets[@cran_titanic], which is extracted from Encyclopedia Titanica[@encyclopedia_titanica].

[**Data Dictionary**]{style="color: brown; font-size: 1.2em;"}<br> The data dictonary for this dataset can be found [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/Stat2Data/Titanic.html).

print(group_counts)
```

::: callout-warning
## Tip: What is the Freq variable?

In the raw dataset, each row represents a combination of class, sex, age, and survival status, along with a frequency column that indicates the number of individuals in each category. This means that rather than having individual rows for each passenger, the dataset has aggregated data, with each row showing the count of individuals with a specific combination of attributes.

In this case, instead of adding a unique ID for each individual, we can work with the Freq column to represent counts.

survival <- women_children %>%

    Total = sum(Freq), # get the total number of frequency

## Note: **How did survival differ by age?**

The figure below demonstrates survival by sex and age. For women, the chance of survival was highest between the ages of 14 and 40. For men, the chance of survival was highest between the ages of 18 and 30.

[**Summary of Results**]{style="color: brown; font-size: 1.2em;"}<br> Based on the analysis, a total of 534 women and children were aboard the Titanic, distributed as follows: 150 in 1st class, 117 in 2nd class, 244 in 3rd class, and 23 crew members. Their survival rate showed a decreasing trend across classes, with a higher survival percentage in higher classes. The majority (over 80%) of women and children in 1st and 2nd class, as well as among the crew, survived, while less than half of those in 3rd class did. This survival rate for 3rd class women and children is comparable to that of men, the majority of whom did not survive. Among men, survival was highest in 1st class and among the crew, followed by 3rd class, with the lowest survival rate observed in 2nd class.
