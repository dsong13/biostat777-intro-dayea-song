    "text": "Survival of Passengers on the Titanic\n\nResearch Question The Titanic, a British ocean liner, was renowned as the largest ship afloat and famously dubbed ‚Äúunsinkable.‚Äù However, during its maiden voyage from England to New York in 1912, the ship tragically sank after striking an iceberg. This disaster led to the loss of many lives, sparking debates about survival factors, especially in the context of social class and the ‚Äúwomen and children first‚Äù policy(Riniolo et al. 2003).\n\n\nWomen and Children First is a disaster protocol designed to prioritize the rescue of vulnerable individuals.*\n\n\nScene from Titanic\n\nThis analysis aims to answer the question: Did the ‚Äúwomen and children first‚Äù policy affect Titanic survival rates differently across passenger classes?\nIntended Audience This analysis is intended for data scientists and a general audience interested in understanding social dynamics through historical events. By examining survival rates across different classes and demographic groups (age and sex), we gain insight into how the ‚Äúwomen and children first‚Äù policy may have been applied unevenly across social strata, reflecting broader societal factors at play.\nDataset Data was obtained from Rdatasets(CRAN 2024), which is extracted from Encyclopedia Titanica(‚ÄúEncyclopedia Titanica‚Äù 2024).\nData Dictionary The data dictonary for this dataset can be found here.\nData Wrangling\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(MASS)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'MASS'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    select\n\nlibrary(wesanderson)\n\ndata(\"Titanic\") # load the Titanic dataset\ntitanic &lt;- as.data.frame(Titanic) # convert to a data frame \nstr(Titanic) # explore the structure of the data\n\n 'table' num [1:4, 1:2, 1:2, 1:2] 0 0 35 0 0 0 17 0 118 154 ...\n - attr(*, \"dimnames\")=List of 4\n  ..$ Class   : chr [1:4] \"1st\" \"2nd\" \"3rd\" \"Crew\"\n  ..$ Sex     : chr [1:2] \"Male\" \"Female\"\n  ..$ Age     : chr [1:2] \"Child\" \"Adult\"\n  ..$ Survived: chr [1:2] \"No\" \"Yes\"\n\n\n\ntitanic &lt;- titanic %&gt;% # convert variables from characters to numerical data \n  mutate(\n    Class = case_when(\n      Class == \"1st\" ~ 1,\n      Class == \"2nd\" ~ 2,\n      Class == \"3rd\" ~ 3,\n      Class == \"Crew\" ~ 0\n    ),\n    Sex = case_when(\n      Sex == \"Male\" ~ 1,\n      Sex == \"Female\" ~ 2\n    ),\n    Age = case_when(\n      Age == \"Child\" ~ 1,\n      Age == \"Adult\" ~ 2\n    ),\n    Survived = case_when(\n      Survived == \"No\" ~ 1,\n      Survived == \"Yes\" ~ 2\n    )\n  )\n\n\ntitanic &lt;- titanic %&gt;% # create a new variable for \"women and children\"\n  mutate(women_and_children = case_when(\n    Age == 1 | (Sex == 2 & Age == 2) ~ 1,\n    TRUE ~ 0\n  ))\n\n\nwomen_children &lt;- titanic %&gt;% # filter data for \"women and children\" \n  filter(women_and_children == \"1\")\n\n\ngroup_counts &lt;- women_children %&gt;%\n  group_by(Class) %&gt;% # group by class \n  summarize(Total = sum(Freq)) # calculate the total frequency by summing the Freq column\nprint(group_counts)\n\n# A tibble: 4 √ó 2\n  Class Total\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     0    23\n2     1   150\n3     2   117\n4     3   244\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: What is the Freq variable?\n\n\n\nIn the raw dataset, each row represents a combination of class, sex, age, and survival status, along with a frequency column that indicates the number of individuals in each category.

For men, the chance of survival was highest between the ages of 18 and 30.\n\n\n\n\nImage Source: (Towards Data Science 2021)\n\nSummary of Results Based on the analysis, a total of 534 women and children were aboard the Titanic, distributed as follows: 150 in 1st class, 117 in 2nd class, 244 in 3rd class, and 23 crew members. Their survival rate showed a decreasing trend across classes, with a higher survival percentage in higher classes. The majority (over 80%) of women and children in 1st and 2nd class, as well as among the crew, survived, while less than half of those in 3rd class did. This survival rate for 3rd class women and children is comparable to that of men, the majority of whom did not survive. Among men, survival was highest in 1st class and among the crew, followed by 3rd class, with the lowest survival rate observed in 2nd class.\n\nList of Functions\nData wrangling with dplyr/tidyr functions:  - mutate() to create new variables - filter() to filter data - group_by() for grouping - summarize() for calculating totals - arrange() for ordering results\nThree plots with different geom_ functions:  - geom_col() for bar plots - geom_point() for survival percentage plot - geom_bar() for the stacked bar plot\nFaceting in at least one plot:  - facet_wrap() in the stacked bar plot\nInclude two different callout blocks:  - Tip about the frequency variable - Note discussing survival by age and sex\nReference at least three unique citations:  - article - dataset - misc\nMargin content: Image from Titanic and text to explain the ‚Äòwomen and children first‚Äô policy"

    "text": "Survival of Passengers on the Titanic\n\nResearch Question The Titanic, a British ocean liner, was renowned as the largest ship afloat and famously dubbed ‚Äúunsinkable.‚Äù However, during its maiden voyage from England to New York in 1912, the ship tragically sank after striking an iceberg. This disaster led to the loss of many lives, sparking debates about survival factors, especially in the context of social class and the ‚Äúwomen and children first‚Äù policy(Riniolo et al. 2003).\n\n\nWomen and Children First is a disaster protocol designed to prioritize the rescue of vulnerable individuals.*\n\n\nScene from Titanic\n\nThis analysis aims to answer the question: Did the ‚Äúwomen and children first‚Äù policy affect Titanic survival rates differently across passenger classes?\nIntended Audience This analysis is intended for data scientists and a general audience interested in understanding social dynamics through historical events. By examining survival rates across different classes and demographic groups (age and sex), we gain insight into how the ‚Äúwomen and children first‚Äù policy may have been applied unevenly across social strata, reflecting broader societal factors at play.\nDataset Data was obtained from Rdatasets(CRAN 2024), which is extracted from Encyclopedia Titanica(‚ÄúEncyclopedia Titanica‚Äù 2024).\nData Dictionary The data dictonary for this dataset can be found here.\nData Wrangling\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(MASS)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'MASS'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    select\n\nlibrary(wesanderson)\n\ndata(\"Titanic\") # load the Titanic dataset\ntitanic &lt;- as.data.frame(Titanic) # convert to a data frame \nstr(Titanic) # explore the structure of the data\n\n 'table' num [1:4, 1:2, 1:2, 1:2] 0 0 35 0 0 0 17 0 118 154 ...\n - attr(*, \"dimnames\")=List of 4\n  ..$ Class   : chr [1:4] \"1st\" \"2nd\" \"3rd\" \"Crew\"\n  ..$ Sex     : chr [1:2] \"Male\" \"Female\"\n  ..$ Age     : chr [1:2] \"Child\" \"Adult\"\n  ..$ Survived: chr [1:2] \"No\" \"Yes\"\n\n\n\ntitanic &lt;- titanic %&gt;% # convert variables from characters to numerical data \n  mutate(\n    Class = case_when(\n      Class == \"1st\" ~ 1,\n      Class == \"2nd\" ~ 2,\n      Class == \"3rd\" ~ 3,\n      Class == \"Crew\" ~ 0\n    ),\n    Sex = case_when(\n      Sex == \"Male\" ~ 1,\n      Sex == \"Female\" ~ 2\n    ),\n    Age = case_when(\n      Age == \"Child\" ~ 1,\n      Age == \"Adult\" ~ 2\n    ),\n    Survived = case_when(\n      Survived == \"No\" ~ 1,\n      Survived == \"Yes\" ~ 2\n    )\n  )\n\n\ntitanic &lt;- titanic %&gt;% # create a new variable for \"women and children\"\n  mutate(women_and_children = case_when(\n    Age == 1 | (Sex == 2 & Age == 2) ~ 1,\n    TRUE ~ 0\n  ))\n\n\nwomen_children &lt;- titanic %&gt;% # filter data for \"women and children\" \n  filter(women_and_children == \"1\")\n\n\ngroup_counts &lt;- women_children %&gt;%\n  group_by(Class) %&gt;% # group by class \n  summarize(Total = sum(Freq)) # calculate the total frequency by summing the Freq column\nprint(group_counts)\n\n# A tibble: 4 √ó 2\n  Class Total\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     0    23\n2     1   150\n3     2   117\n4     3   244\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: What is the Freq variable?\n\n\n\nIn the raw dataset, each row represents a combination of class, sex, age, and survival status, along with a frequency column that indicates the number of individuals in each category. This means that rather than having individual rows for each passenger, the dataset has aggregated data, with each row showing the count of individuals with a specific combination of attributes.\nIn this case, instead of adding a unique ID for each individual, we can work with the Freq column to represent counts.\n\n\n\nsurvival &lt;- women_children %&gt;%\n  group_by(Class) %&gt;% # group by class \n  summarize(\n    Total = sum(Freq), # get the total number of frequency \n    Survived = sum(Freq[Survived == \"2\"])) %&gt;%\n  mutate(survival_percentage = (Survived / Total) * 100) %&gt;% # calculate survival percentage\n  arrange(desc(survival_percentage)) # arrange by highest to lowest \n\nprint(survival)\n\n# A tibble: 4 √ó 4\n  Class Total Survived survival_percentage\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1   150      146                97.3\n2     2   117      104                88.9\n3     0    23       20                87.0\n4     3   244      103                42.2\n\n\n\nnumber &lt;- titanic %&gt;%\n  group_by(Class, women_and_children) %&gt;% # group by class and women and children \n  summarize(Total = sum(Freq))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Class'.

For women, the chance of survival was highest between the ages of 14 and 40. For men, the chance of survival was highest between the ages of 18 and 30.\n\n\n\n\nImage Source: (Towards Data Science 2021)\n\nSummary of Results Based on the analysis, a total of 534 women and children were aboard the Titanic, distributed as follows: 150 in 1st class, 117 in 2nd class, 244 in 3rd class, and 23 crew members. Their survival rate showed a decreasing trend across classes, with a higher survival percentage in higher classes. The majority (over 80%) of women and children in 1st and 2nd class, as well as among the crew, survived, while less than half of those in 3rd class did. This survival rate for 3rd class women and children is comparable to that of men, the majority of whom did not survive. Among men, survival was highest in 1st class and among the crew, followed by 3rd class, with the lowest survival rate observed in 2nd class.\n\nList of Functions\nData wrangling with dplyr/tidyr functions:  - mutate() to create new variables - filter() to filter data - group_by() for grouping - summarize() for calculating totals - arrange() for ordering results\nThree plots with different geom_ functions:  - geom_col() for bar plots - geom_point() for survival percentage plot - geom_bar() for the stacked bar plot\nFaceting in at least one plot:  - facet_wrap() in the stacked bar plot\nInclude two different callout blocks:  - Tip about the frequency variable - Note discussing survival by age and sex\nReference at least three unique citations:  - article - dataset - misc\nMargin content: Image from Titanic and text to explain the ‚Äòwomen and children first‚Äô policy"
